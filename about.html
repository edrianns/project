        <h1>History</h1>
        <p> Ste. Anne de Beaupré School has a very humble and simple beginning. Its owner, founder and Directress, Miss
            Aurora T. Apuada, had much enthusiasm to begin with. She first envisioned to cater the needs of children
            with special needs, and with her Special Education (SPED) degree from the University of the Philippines and
            meager personal funds as capital, she established St. Anne’s Special School in 1974. Housed in a makeshift
            classroom in a garage in #7 Cattleya St. Mindanao Avenue Subdivision, in Quezon City, the school started its
            operations with only four students for the school year 1974-1975. With the coming years, substantial
            increase in enrollment came by, so St. Anne’s School had to transfer to a bigger and better place. Due to
            its efficient operations, constant improvement of facilities and the inspiring transformation of its
            student-products, the school was recognized shortly in 1980 – the first private special school DECS-NCR to
            be granted full recognition.<br><br>
            Seeing the need to put up a school for the purpose of mainstreaming the special children and by insistent
            request of parents who believe so much in her ability to make a difference even for the regular children,
            the founder-directress established Ste. Anne de Beaupré School, her regular school in 1987. Starting with
            the pilot Pre-School Level, the other levels soon followed one after the other, year after year, with all
            courses duly recognized by the DECS. Ste. Anne de Beaupré School is very proud to have its first batch of
            High School graduates in March, 1996. From then on, every year sees a new batch of proud and able high
            school graduates – Ste. Anne graduates molded to possess the necessary wisdom, training, skills and
            knowledge needed for the more arduous task of tertiary education, and life in general. The graduates have
            been admitted to prestigious schools and universities. Annean graduates have become professionals in
            different fields, such as in medicine, law, architecture, engineering, IT, business and education. Now on
            its 36th year, expect the school to once again deliver awesome activities, its top-notch educational system,
            and its trademark strict but reasonable adherence to values formation for all students.
